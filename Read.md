 ![love running logo here]

Welcome,

This is a sample love running project created using replit and pushed to github. 

this project was created to test my understanding and to put to test what i have learnt for 10 weeks.

I find this project very useful especially for my milestone project as it was easy for me to quickly refresh my memory while going over this project again.

## love running

the project was created using only HTML and CSS

I will be reviewing this project often and will use this to pracitse as i learn new coding related skills.
